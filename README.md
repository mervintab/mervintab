# [Mervin Tabernero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mervintab/)’s IT & Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

Welcome to my cybersecurity and IT portfolio! I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional with a background in medical technology, now fully immersed in the world of digital defense. I enjoy solving complex problems through hands-on, practical projects that strengthen security postures and improve operational efficiency.

Here, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect my skills in vulnerability management, threat hunting, scripting, and more. These experiences continue to shape my journey as I pursue a career in cybersecurity—one challenge at a time.

## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management Projects

Projects focused on identifying, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across environments.

- 🔧 **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/mervintab/vulnerability-management-program)**  
  Designed and documented a structured vulnerability management process using best practices, tools, and frameworks. Covers asset discovery, risk scoring, and remediation workflows.

- 💻 **[Programmatic Vulnerability Remediations (PowerShell & BASH)](https://github.com/joshcybertest/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations)**  
  Scripts developed to automate the remediation of vulnerabilities across Windows and Linux systems. Demonstrates proficiency in secure scripting and system hardening.

- 💻 **[STIG Implementation Repository)](https://github.com/joshcybertest/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations)**  
  This repository contains PowerShell scripts and documentation for implementing and remediating DISA STIG requirements on Windows systems. It is intended to support system hardening, compliance auditing, and secure configuration management.

## 🔐 Security Tools & Automation

- 🛠️ **[Firewall Log Analyzer Script](https://github.com/mervintab/scripts-public/tree/main/firewall_log_analyzer)**  
  Parses and visualizes firewall logs to identify anomalies and potential intrusion attempts.

- 📊 **[SIEM Log Ingestion Pipeline](https://github.com/mervintab/siem-log-ingestion)**  
  Built a basic log ingestion setup that simulates log forwarding from endpoints to a SIEM.

- 🐍 **[Log to JSON Parser (Python)](https://github.com/mervintab/scripts-public/tree/main/log_to_json_converter)**  
  A Python script that reads raw log files and converts them into structured JSON format for easier ingestion, analysis, or integration with SIEM platforms. Great for transforming legacy logs into modern formats.
